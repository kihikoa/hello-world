This repo is for practicing GitHub Flow
Hi! My name is Angela Kihiko, and I live in Louisville, KY. I went to Spelman College, and got a degree in CS. When I found Code Louisville, I thought it could help me gain some skills because I have been out of CS for a while. Plus, I look forward to the UX section becuase I have never done it before. Thank you :)!
